 <h1> Distributed Graph Store </h1>

			<b> Summary </b>
		</p>
     Over the course of a semester, we collaborated on four iterations of a graph store that handles graph requests.
</body>
  <p> 
  <a href="https://github.com/AlexisSaiontz/426-Lab1">First iteration:</a> Simple HTTP API for an in-memory graph
	  <p> This iteration stores undirected graphs. The graph was hosted on an http server, which could recieve http requests from clients.
		Note: This assignment was pair-programmed (contributions reflect commits from Stelios's account)
	</p>
   </p> 
	<p> 
  <a href="https://github.com/AlexisSaiontz/426-Lab2">Second iteration:</a> Durability
	  <p> This iteration adds durability to the graph store by storing the graph on-disk. A logging feature was added, providing failure atomicity.
	</p>
<p> 
  <a href="https://github.com/AlexisSaiontz/426-Lab3">Third iteration:</a> Reliability via Chain-Replication
	  <p> Adds reliability via RPC communication between server replicas. 
	</p>
   </p> 
<p> 
  <a href="https://github.com/AlexisSaiontz/426-Lab4">Fourth iteration:</a> Partioned for scalability
	  <p> Graph-store is partitioned across multiple machines via RPCs
	</p>
