			<b> Summary </b>
		</p>
     Over the course of a semester, we collaborated on four iterations of a graph store that handles graph requests.

  <p> 
  <a href="https://github.com/AlexisSaiontz/Lab1-CloudService">First iteration:</a> Simple HTTP API for an in-memory graph
	  <p> This iteration stores undirected graphs. The graph was hosted on an http server, which could recieve http requests from clients.
